- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Fredrik, a hobby developer living in Sweden
- ðŸ‘€ SvelteKit, Python, Rust and Postgres satisfies my curiosity
- ðŸŒ± Vercel, WSL and the cheapest VM I can find is enough for my deployments
-  âœ’ Vim for single files and edits, Pycharm for that quick Python visualization and VS Code for everything else
